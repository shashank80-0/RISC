32-bit RISC Processor using VERILOG

I hereby declare that this project represents my own ideas in my own words and 
where other ideas or words have been included, have adequately cited and referenced the original sources.

Started as a project for final term in college.
This project is an implementation of a 32-Bit RISC processor using verilog paper reference below.

This is not the complete RISC processor, further modules to be implemented are CONTROL UNIT and GENERAL PURPOSE REGISTER. 
Furthermore we have to verify this design using simulation and compare the performance of our processor with other processors in terms of delay, power dissipation etc.
